# Search and Query APIs 

ArrowDB provides APIs for querying and searching ArrowDB objects. 
The query APIs allow you to perform custom database-style searches, while search APIs perform a full text search using the ArrowDB search engine.

<p class="note">The search API is deprecated since Release 1.3.0. Applications created before Arrow
Cloud Release 1.3.0 can continue to use the deprecated search API, but new applications will need to use
the query API with the <code>$text</code> query operator.</p>


## Query API Overview

The query API provides an interface for applying database-style query constraints on predefined objects 
and [custom fields](#!/guide/customfields). 

When no query parameters are provided, all objects of the specified type are returned with 
default pagination. You can control pagination of queries with the `skip` and `limit` parameters, or by
using a custom `where` clause. See [Query Pagination](#!/guide/search_query-section-query-pagination)
for more information.

You can also control the sort order of query results using the `order` parameter, 
and specify the fields you want to include (or exclude) from results using the `sel` and
`unsel` query parameters.

### Query API Availability

The following ArrowDB object provide query methods: {@link ACLs#query ACLs}, {@link Chats#query Chats}, 
{@link Checkins#query Checkins}, {@link CustomObjects#query CustomObjects}, {@link Events#query Events}, 
{@link Files#query Files}, {@link GeoFences#query GeoFences}, 
{@link KeyValues#query KeyValues}, {@link Likes#query Likes}, {@link Logs}, 
{@link Messages#query Messages}, {@link Photos#query Photos}, {@link Places#query Places}, 
{@link Posts#query Posts}, {@link PushNotifications#query PushNotifications},
{@link PushSchedules#query PushSchedules}, {@link Reviews#query Reviews}, {@link Statuses#query Statuses},
 and {@link Users#query Users}.

For security reasons, when querying for {@link Users} the {@link Users#email email} field is not returned
in the User object unless you have [admin access](#!/guide/admin_access).

### Query parameters

The following parameters are available for query operations:

  * `count`
  * `limit` and `skip`
  * `where`
  * `order`
  * `sel`
  * `unsel`
  * `page` 
  * `per_page`


#### count

If the query includes `count=true`, the response's meta object contains a `count` field 
whose value is the total number of objects that matched the query criteria. 
If the query matches more than 5000 objects, the count field contains the value "5000+". For more information, see 
[Query Pagination](#!/guide/search_query-section-query-pagination).

#### page

<p class="note">
Starting in ArrowDB 1.1.5, page and per_page are no longer supported in query operations. 
Applications should instead use <strong>skip</strong> and <strong>limit</strong> 
query parameters.
</p>

#### per_page

<p class="note">
Starting in ArrowDB 1.1.5, page and per_page are no longer supported in query operations. 
Applications should instead use <strong>skip</strong> and <strong>limit</strong>
query parameters.
</p>

#### limit

The number of records to fetch. The value must be greater than 0, and no greater than 
1000, or an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error will be returned. Default value of `limit` is 10.

#### new_pagination

When `new_pagination=true` is included in a query, the number of records evaluated in the database is limited to 5000. 

By default, ArrowDB puts no limit on the number of records that are evaluated
in the database. This means, for example, that if you execute an open-ended query for all ArrowDB objects of some type, and apply a sort and filter on the results, all records in the database are evaluated, sorted and filtered in memory.

For applications that have relatively small numbers of total
records (< 5000) this operation can by completed efficiently with no
noticeable impact on your application's performance. However, if a table
has a very large number (>= 1 million) records these kinds of operations are
very inefficient, and your users will notice a performance hit.

#### skip

The number of records to skip. The value must be greater than or equal to 0, and no greater 
than 4999, or an HTTP 400 error will be returned. To skip 5000 records or more 
you need to perform a range-based query. See 
<a href="#!/guide/search_query-section-query-pagination">Query Pagination</a> for more information.</p>

#### where

Constrains values for fields. The value should be encoded JSON. Each value in the search query needs
to be less that 1024 bytes.  If the value is larger than 1024 bytes, the query does not return any
results.

Each type of ArrowDB object has a set of predefined fields that can be queried with the `where` operator. 
See each object's individual `query` method for details. 

In addition, you can query the [custom fields](#!/guide/customfields) on any object. Note, however, 
that you can only query simple values, such as Strings, Dates, Numbers, or Booleans. 
If a custom field takes an array or object as a value, you can't query any of the values stored inside the array or object.  

For more information, see [Supported Data Types](#!/guide/customfields-section-supported-data-types).

Currently, ArrowDB does not support case insensitive query. To perform case insensitive query 
on a field, save an additional normalized copy of the original field and perform the query on the
normalized field instead.

To perform an exact match on a field, for example, to  search for users with `first_name`
matching "joe", use:
    
    where={"first_name": "joe"}

You can add more search criteria by adding them together. For example, to search for
users with `first_name` matching "joe", `favorite_color` matching "blue" and `age` of
28, use the following query:

    where={"age": 28, "favorite_color": "blue", "first_name" : "joe"}
    
For non-exact matches, `where` supports these options:
    
<table class="doc-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Operator</th><th>Summary</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$lt</code></td>
        <td>Less than</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$lte</code></td>
        <td>Less than or equal to</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$gt</code></td>
        <td>Greater than</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$gte</code></td>
        <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$ne</code></td>
        <td>Not equal to</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$in</code></td>
        <td>Contained in, allows you to specify an array of possible matches</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$nin</code></td>
        <td>Not contained in, it selects objects for which the specified field does not have any value in the specified array </td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$or</code></td>
        <td>Use boolean or in a query ,an array of expressions, any of which can match</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$nor</code></td>
        <td>A boolean or expression to do queries, you give $nor a list of expressions, none of which can match the query </td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$and</code></td>
        <td>Give $and an array of expressions, all of which must match the query </td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$all</code></td>
        <td>The $all operator is similar to $in, but instead of matching any value in the specified array all values in the array must be matched </td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$elemMatch</code></td>
        <td>Give $elemMatch an expression to match against elements in an array</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$exists</code></td>
        <td>Check for existence of a field </td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$regex</code></td>
        <td>Regex match on a string. Currently, only prefix matches are supported: the
        regular expression must begin with an anchor (^) followed by a letter or digit. For
        example, '^a', '^a.*', and '^a.*$' are allowed, but not '^.*a*'.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$text</code></td>
        <td>Perform a text search on the contents of the field. A <b>$text</b> expression has the
            following syntax: <br/>
            <code> { "$text": { "$search": &lt;string&gt; }} </code><br/>
            Most punctuation marks and spaces are treated as delimiters allowing you to search for
            multiple keywords, excluding escaped double quotes (\&quot;) and hypens (-).  Escaped
            double quotes are used for phrase searches and hyphens are used to negate searches.
            Sorting does not work with the $text operator, that is, using the
            <code>order</code> field will have no effect when using the $text operator.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

For querying geographic coordinates, the following operators are supported:

<table class="doc-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Operator</th><th>Summary</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$nearSphere&nbsp&nbsp</code></td>
        <td>Search near geographic coordinates, format is <code>[longitude, latitude]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>$maxDistance</code></td>
        <td>used with $nearSphere to limit maximum search distance. All distances use radians. This allows you to easily multiply by the radius of the earth (about 6371 km or 3959 miles) to get the distance in your choice of units. Conversely, divide by the radius of the earth when doing queries</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    
You can combine any of the above to build a more complex query.
    
If you want to find users with age older than 28:

    where={"age": {"$gt":28}}

If you want to find users at age 28 or 38:
    
    where = {"age": {"$in":[28,38]}}
    
If you want to find users at age neither 28 nor 38:

    where = {"age": {"$nin":[28,38]}}
    
If you want to find a user whose email is "john@example.com" and type is User:

    where={"$and": [ {"email" : "john@example.com"}, { "_type" : "User" } ] }
    
If you want to find users who have options are 2,3
    
    where={"options": {"$all" : [2,3] } }

If you want to find users who have location information.
    
    where={"location": {"$exists" : true} }

If you want to find users who haven't location information
    
    where={"location": {"$exists" : false} }

If you have a custom array with your user object, such as a list of scores
(scores: `[65, 86, 92'`), you can search the elements in the array. For example,
if you want to search for scores within a certain range:

    where={"scores":{ "$elemMatch": { "$gte": 70, "$lt": 90 } }}

If you have a custom array of tags, such as `tags: [ 'employee', 'manager' ]`,
you can use the $all operator to return objects that contain all the specified elements.

    where={"tags":{ "$all": [ 'employee', 'manager' ] } }

If you have assigned custom coordinates to your user objects, you can search
by users' coordinates. For example, if you want to find users named joe near
longitude -122.1 and latitude 37.1.
    
    where={"first_name":"joe", "coordinates":{"$nearSphere":[-122.1, 37.1]}}
    
To find users named joe near longitude -122.1 and latitude 37.1 with maximum
distance of 5 miles (convert 5 miles to radians, 5/3959 = 0.00126)

    where={"first_name":"joe", "coordinates":{"$nearSphere":[-122.1,37.1], "$maxDistance" : 0.00126}}

To search for the keywords `javascript`, `ruby` or `python`, but not `php`:

    where={"$text": { "$search": "javascript,ruby,python,-php" }}
    
#### order

Sort results by one or more fields. In general, you can sort based on any predefined field that you can query using
the `where` operator, as well as on custom fields. Any exceptions to this rule are noted in API reference for the 
individual `query` methods.

To reverse the sorting order, simply add `-` in front of a field. For example,
to sort results by first_name in ascending order then created_at in descending
order:
    
    order=first_name,-created_at

#### sel

Selects which fields to return from the query. Do not use this parameter if you are using the
`unsel` parameter.

Assign an array of field names to filter to the `all` field to search all JSON fields including
fields in nested objects.  Currently, this is the only supported option.

If you want to display a field from the `custom_field` object, simply pass the field name of the
`custom_field` object.

If you want to display a field from a nested object, then both the name of the nested object and
field need to be specified.

For example, if you want to only return the `first_name` field:

    sel={"all":["first_name"]}

#### unsel

Selects which fields to not return from the query. Do not use this parameter if you are using the
`sel` parameter.

Assign an array of field names to filter to the `all` field to search all JSON fields including
fields in nested objects.  Currently, this is the only supported option.

If you want to hide displaying a field from the `custom_field` object, simply pass the field name of the
`custom_field` object.

If you want to hide displaying a field from a nested object, then both the name of the nested object and
field need to be specified.

For example, if you want to return all fields except `first_name`:

    unsel={"all":["first_name"]}

## Query Pagination

Starting with ArrowDB 1.1.5, we have made the following changes:

* Skip is limited to 0-4999; as a result you can not skip beyond 5000 records.
* If the query includes `count=true`, the query response's `meta` object contains a `count` 
field whose value is the total number of objects that match the query criteria. 
If the query matches more than 5000 objects, the `count` field contains the value "5000+". 
If your query result set includes more than 5000 records, 
you should perform range-based queries for pagination. This is done by including 
a where parameter on a object field using the `$gt` or `$lt` operators, as discussed
below.

For example, the following cURL uses a range-based query for Statuses whose custom field named `score` is less than
100, and sorts the results in ascending order on the `score` field:

    $ curl -d 'where={"score":{"$lt":100}}&order=score' -X GET "http://<HOST>/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=true"

ArrowDB object IDs, represented by the `_id` field, are based on object timestamps and machine IDs, which allows for range-based pagination. For
example, suppose an application performs a query that whose last object
returned has an ID of `"5418a8815a6919fde8cf1e4d"`. To get the
set of objects created before that particular object, the application would query for those objects whose `_id` field is less than that value:

    $ curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$lt":"5418a8815a6919fde8cf1e4d"}}' "http://<HOST>/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=t&_session_id=<SESSION_ID>"

Similarly, if the ID of the first object returned in a query was
`"5418a87f5a6919fde8cee391"` the application would query on objects whose `_id`
field is greater than that value to retrieve the previous set of data:

    $ curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$gt":"5418a87f5a6919fde8cee391"}}' "http://<HOST>/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=t&_session_id=<SESSION_ID>"

To query objects between a range of object IDs, use together `$gt` and `$lt` together:

    curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$gt":"5418a87f5a6919fde8cee38f", "$lt":"5418a8815a6919fde8cf1e4d"}}'  "http://<HOST>/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=t&_session_id=<SESSION_ID>"    

For additional examples, see [Range-based Query Pagination Examples](#!/guide/search_query-section-range-based-query-pagination-examples).

#### Query on Custom Field, Results in Ascending Order

In this example, the query returns Statuses objects whose custom `score` field
is less than 100, and sorts results on the `score` in ascending order
(`&order=score`). The query matches 100 total records.

    ~ curl -d 'where={"score":{"$lt":100}}&order=score' -X GET "http://<HOST>:8082/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=true"
    {

            "custom_fields": {
              "score": 2.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f675413d",
            "custom_fields": {

              "score": 4.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f675413f",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score": 5.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f6754140",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score": 6.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f6754141",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score": 7.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f6754142",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score": 8.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f6754143",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score": 9.0
            }, ...
          }
        ]
      }
    }

#### Query on Custom Field, Results in Descending Order

In this example, Statuses objects are queried whose custom `score` field is less
than 100, and sorts results on `score` in descending order (`&order=-score`).


    $ curl -d 'where={"score":{"$lt":100}}&order=-score' -X GET "http://<HOST>/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=true"
    {
      "meta": {
        "code": 200,
        "status": "ok",
        "method_name": "queryStatuses",
        "count": 100
      },
      "response": {
        "statuses": [
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f675419d",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score" 99.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f675419c",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score" 98.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f675419b",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score" 97.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f675419a",
            "custom_fields": {

            "custom_fields": {
              "score" 94.0
            }, ...
          },
          {
            "id": "53fe1c25759220e9f6754197",
            "custom_fields": {
              "score" 93.0
            }, ...

In this example, the next page of Statuses objects are queried whose `_id` field is less than `"53fe1c25759220e9f6754194"` and sorted in descending order on the custom `score` field.

    $ curl -d 'where={"score":{"$lt":100},"_id":{"$lt":"53fe1c25759220e9f6754194"}}&order=-score' -X GET "http://<HOST>/v1/statuses/query.json?key=<KEY>&count=true&pretty_json=true"

#### Query for Previous Page of Results

As explained previously, to get the second (or next) page of results in a query, you query
for objects whose `_id` field is less (older) than the `_id` of the last object returned by
the prior query. To get the previous (first) page of results again, you simply query for those objects 
whose `_id` is greater (newer) than the first object returned in by the prior query.

However, if you query for the third results page, and want to get the previous (second) results page, you 
need to restrict the query to those objects whose `_id` is greater than the first object returned by the most recent query 
(third results page), and less than that of the last object returned in query before that (second results page); or,
equivalently, less than or equal to the first object returned in the initial query (first results page). 
The following demonstrates this.

**First Page (Page 1)**

The first query request doesn't specify a range.

Request:

    curl -X GET "<HOST>/v1/users/query.json?key=<KEY>&new_pagination=true&pretty_json=true"

Response (abbreviated):

    {
      "response": {
        "users": [
          {
            "id": "5447f04580e61e081e0002c6",
            ...
          },
          ...
          {
            "id": "5447eff680e61e08260002ed",
            ...
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Note that the ID of the last object returned in the response ("5447eff680e61e08260002ed"). 

**Next Page (Page 2)**

To get Page 2 results, a `where` clause is added 
that limits results to those objects whose `_id` field is less than the
last object in Page 1 results ("5447eff680e61e08260002ed").

Request:

    curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$lt":"5447eff680e61e08260002ed"}}' "<HOST>/v1/users/query.json?key=<KEY>&new_pagination=true&pretty_json=true"

Response (abbreviated):

    {
      "response": {
        "users": [
          {
            "id": "5447efed80e61e08260002ec",
            ...
          },
            ...
          {
            "id": "5447ef9f80e61e081e0002c1",
            ...
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Note that the first and last IDs of objects returned on Page 2 are "5447efed80e61e08260002ec" and "5447ef9f80e61e081e0002c1",
respectively. To get the previous page of results (Page 1) at this point, you could simply query for
objects with IDs greater than the first object in the Page 2 results ("5447efed80e61e08260002ec"). 
In this case, however, the user requests the next page (Page 3) results, as shown below.

**Next Page (Page 3)** 

To get Page 3 results, the `where` limits results to those objects 
whose `_id` field is less the last object returned in Page 2 results ("5447ef9f80e61e081e0002c1").

    $ curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$lt":"5447ef9f80e61e081e0002c1"}}' "<HOST>/v1/users/query.json?key=<KEY>&new_pagination=true&pretty_json=true"

Response (abbreviated):

    {
      "response": {
        "users": [
          {
            "id": "5446d5d980e61e0826000093",
            ...
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }

Note that the first object returned has the ID "5446d5d980e61e0826000093".

**Previous Page (Page 2)**

At this point, if you query for objects with IDs greater than the first object returned in Page 3, 
you would, logically, get Page 1 results, not Page 2. Instead, you need to further limit the range to those objects 
with IDs less than or equal to that of the first object from the Page 2 results; or, equivalently, 
less than that of the last object id from Page 1 results. 

Continuing the example, the request and response (abbreviated) for these approaches are shown below:
 
    $ curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$gt":"5446d5d980e61e0826000093", "$lte":"5447efed80e61e08260002ec"}}' "<HOST>/v1/users/query.json?key=<KEY>&new_pagination=true&pretty_json=true"
    {
      "response": {
        "users": [
          {
            "id": "5447efed80e61e08260002ec",
            ...
          },
          ...
          {
            "id": "5447ef9f80e61e081e0002c1",
            ...
        ]
      }
    }

    $ curl -X GET -d 'where={"_id":{"$gt":"5446d5d980e61e0826000093", "$lt":"5447eff680e61e08260002ed"}}' "<HOST>/v1/users/query.json?key=<KEY>&new_pagination=true&pretty_json=true"
    {
      "response": {
        "users": [
          {
            "id": "5447efed80e61e08260002ec",
            ...
          },
          ...
          {
            "id": "5447ef9f80e61e081e0002c1",
            ...
          }
        ]
      }
    }


## Search API Overview

<p class="note">The search API is deprecated since Release 1.3.0. Applications created before Arrow Cloud
Release 1.3.0 can continue to use the deprecated search API, but new applications will need to use
the query API with the <code>$text</code> query operator.</p>

Several ArrowDB objects provides a search API that performs a case-insensitive, full-text
search of the given keywords on a list of predefined fields. Please refer to individual object's API
documentation for a list of searchable fields. For instance, the {@link Places#search} method will search 
within {@link Places#name} and {@link Places#tags}.

The Search API is fixed in terms of the searchable fields; use the [query](#!/guide/search_query-section-query-api-overview) 
API to perform more flexible searches.

### Search API Parameters

The following parameters are available for search operations:

  * `page`
  * `per_page`
  * `q`

#### page

Request page number starting from 1. Default is 1. 

#### per_page

Number of results per page. Default is 10.

#### q

The keyword or phrase to search for.

### Search API Availability

Search methods are available for the following pre-built ArrowDB objects, as well as for custom fields.

* {@link Events#search Events}
* {@link Friends#search Friends}
* {@link Places#search Places}
* {@link Users#search Users}
